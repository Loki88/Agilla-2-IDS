Release Notes
-------------

For this to work the hardware should be supported by the tkn154 TinyOs library. At this moment only the CC2420 radio chip is supported. Support for RF230 radio chip has been added in https://github.com/Loki88/TKN154-Iris.git, but the beacon enabled mode is not fully supported, however it's not needed by Agilla 2 to work.
